The docs/ directory is intended for miscellaneous documentation and text file storage.

Files that should be in this location :
  ua.txt    -- listing of ua strings to be used with -v|--vary
  usage.md  -- basic usage explanation and examples
  *.cfg     -- encoded configuration files (a la pokeyworks:pokeyconfig)
